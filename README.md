Over the past few weeks, I have been diving deep into web development and am thrilled to announce the completion of my latest project: an Age Converter built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! 🌐

This project was not just about converting ages from years to days, months, weeks; it was a comprehensive learning experience that allowed me to enhance my skills in:

HTML: Structuring the content and ensuring semantic accuracy.
CSS: Styling the application to create a responsive and visually appealing user interface.
JavaScript: Implementing dynamic functionality and ensuring smooth user interactions.

# Key Features:
✅ User-Friendly Interface: Clean and intuitive design for seamless user experience.
✅ Real-Time Conversion: Instant age conversion as you type, thanks to JavaScript.
✅ Responsive Design: Works flawlessly across various devices and screen sizes.
✅ Error Handling: Robust validation to handle edge cases and invalid inputs.

What I Learned:
📘 Responsive Design Principles: Ensuring the app looks great on both desktop and mobile.
📘 JavaScript Event Handling: Making the UI interactive and user-friendly.
📘 CSS Flexbox and Grid: Advanced layout techniques for a flexible and adaptive design.
